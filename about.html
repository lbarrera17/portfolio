  <div class="introduction">
  <p>Hi, I am Laura. I've always wished to have a simple, straight to the point manner in which I could introduce myself but, to be sincere, I am unable to choose one. It seems that the more I live, the more I realize that I wholeheartedly lack the ability, or willingness,
  to constrict myself to a box. </p>

  <p>Maybe that's why I love stories, and complex ones in particular, because they defy systemization. Also maybe why I love visual art,
  because our perception is an equation of timing and location, of all scales,
  and the effect relayed upon us is always in flux.</p>

  <p>I suppose I am an artist, though I lack an art degree or any serious art credential.
  And, I guess, I am also an intellectual, though the term lands weirdly on me—I am always joking around.</p>

  <p>But if you insist in wanting to know more about me other than these vague claims, then here you go: I am Colombian-born, lived in Santiago, Chile for eight years, and moved to
    south Florida at age 11, where I stayed until I went away to college. At Cornell, I majored in Industrial and Labor Relations, minored in English
    and took classes in a variety of subjects in a myriad of departments because I am a very curious person and not in the least bit indecisive!

  <p>In any way, I hope you enjoy the content. If you have any comments or feedback or questions (or concerns),
  please feel free to message me...anywhere. I love to chat.</p>

  <p>Laura</p>
