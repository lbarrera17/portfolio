Hi, I am Laura. <p>

<p>I have always wished to have a simple, straight to the point manner in which I could introduce myself but, to be sincere, I seem to be unable to choose one. It seems the more I live the more I realize that I wholeheartedly lack the ability, or willingness,
to constrict myself to a single box of being. </p>

<p>Maybe that's why I love stories, and complex ones in particular, because they defy systemization. Also maybe why I love visual art,
because our perception is an equation of timing and location, of all scales,
and the effect relayed upon us always in flux.</p>

<p>I suppose I am an artist, though I lack an art degree or any serious art credential.
And, I guess, I am also an intellectual of sorts, though the term lands weirdly on me--I am always joking around.</p>

<p>In any way, I hope you enjoy the content. If you have any comments or feedback or questions (or concerns),
please feel free to message me...anywhere. I love to chat.</p>
