<h2>Poetry as a Political Force</h2>

<p>The connection between poetry and politics can perhaps be best discussed by first considering the relationship between the personal and the political. Although a complex subject, influenced by a multitude of factors, the conclusion I have drawn is the political is always personal. But is the inverse also true? Is the personal always political? I believe this is what poetry, political poetry, tries to accomplish. Through its succinct form, ambiguity, and commitment to emotional engagement, poetry captures all. It instills in its readers a greater awareness, or a desire to become more aware, to then understand, explain, and deconstruct the already settled. In times of political turmoil, when the exterior chaos seeps into our psyches, we turn to art for support, for therapy. We often hope for it to tell us how we should live. </p>

<p><em>Purgatory</em> is a collection of poems written by Chilean poet Raul Zurita. The poems stem from the day of Pinochet’s coup, where Zúrita was arrested and tortured. The poems are rather strange. They are striking and confusing, personal and distant. As a reader, I feel an oscillation between remoteness and closeness. Yet, the clearest binding force to them all is the concept of pain. In the preface, Zúrita confesses: “It is difficult for me to comment on my own work, but I feel like Purgatory represents a certain image of what pain can generate, of its desperation, but also, I hope, of its beauty.” If there’s a certainty that <em>Purgatory</em> can capture, or represent, is that there is none. His memory fails him, and he fails himself, and from total wreckage, total loss, <em>Purgatory</em> is Zúrita’s attempt at living, once again.</p>

<p>The book begins with the following poem: “my friends think//I am a sick woman// because I burned my left cheek.” Earlier in the preface, Zúrita explains that the idea of Purgatory began with this very act, for “When faced with horror, we had to respond with art that was stronger and more vast than the pain and damage inflicted on us.”  This act, in particular, had occurred to him after he recalled the New Testament phrase: “if someone strikes your right cheek, turn the other to him.” Whether the act of self-harm was a calculated artistic performance to exemplify non-violent resistance while also maintaining that violence is often internalized, or whether it was because self-harm can offer us a sense of control or make emotional pain more tangible, it nonetheless turns the deeply personal into a political matter. The public display of his self-mutilated face begs us to question in what kind of state must a person be where the idea of voluntarily burning one’s face can be considered, or even desired. Later in the book, we find a note from a psychologist stating that Raul Zurita’s most probable diagnosis is an “epileptic psychosis”; his name is scratched out, next to it we find written: “/Violeta/Sweet Beatriz/Rosamunda/Manuela” and at the bottom of the page “OVE YOU I LOVE YOU INFINITELY L.” It is through poems like these that as readers we are submerged into the Pinochet dictatorship, where we then attempt to imagine the trauma thousands faced and then contend with the silence that has become of it. Unlike using statistics, or detailed descriptions of the horrific acts committed, Purgatory captures dictatorships’ most intimate effects on the population: it captures the despair, the tremendous loss, and the madness. It is no longer reduced to an unfortunate event, or as the failings or shortcomings of governments or politics, but as a pain, a psychic pain, that few can comprehend. </p>

<p>Bolaño’s <em>By Night in Chile</em> has a related effect, though perhaps more perplexing intellectually than emotionally. The book begins as the narrator, Sebastian Urrutia Lacroix, or Father Ibacache, lies on his death bed. Overcome with an anxiety that is palpable yet unimaginable as few of us can empathize with such a proximity to death, he begins to tell his story; the story of a Chilean priest, poet and literary critic. Blaming the “wizened youth” for his sudden loss of peace, he is compelled to clear up a “couple of points” about his life. With a commitment to take full responsibility over his words and silences, he rummages through his memories, seeking peace, or, as we will later learn, forgiveness. The fallibility and ephemerality of memory is a common subject throughout the book, and so too the sense that he is desperately trying to find a way to tell his story accurately. He mentions how “sometimes I even forget my own name (3)”, how “it is something my memory has not retained” (5) and how “my memory is failing me” (6). At other instances, we gather a voracious self-awareness, “...and then I thought, or maybe the thought has only occurred to me now, that life is a succession of misunderstandings” (4). These moments of sincerity make Urrutia Lacroix seem, initially, like a man of integrity, a trusted source.
